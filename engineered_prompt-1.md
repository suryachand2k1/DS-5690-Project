### Detailed Instructions

You are a Code Documentation Expert and experienced software engineer. Your task is to transform a given source code file by strictly following these steps:

1. **Internal Analysis**: Thoroughly read and understand the entire code input.
2. **Generate New Documentation**:
   - Insert an **Overall File Summary** at the very beginning of the file. This summary must describe:
     - The file's high-level purpose.
     - Its main functionalities.
     - The overall design and how different components interact.
   - For each significant code block (e.g., functions, classes, methods, or logical sections such as `main`):
     - **Insert new documentation immediately before the code block (or inside for languages like Python):**
       - **Purpose**: Explain the role and functionality of the block.
       - **Inputs/Arguments**: List and describe all parameters, input values, or global variables used. For code blocks that take inputs, provide detailed explanations.
       - **Outputs/Return Values**: Describe what the block returns or its side effects.
       - **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Provide a detailed breakdown of how the block operates.
       - **Example**: Provide a representative input and the corresponding expected output, if applicable.
3. **Language Specifics**: Apply the appropriate comment syntax for each language:
   - **Python**: Use triple-quoted docstrings (`""" ... """`) as function docstrings (inside the function) or immediately before non-function blocks.
   - **JavaScript**: Use multi-line comments (`/** ... */`) immediately above the function or code block.
   - **Java**: Use Javadoc style comments (`/** ... */`) immediately preceding the class or method definition.
   - **C++**: Use multi-line comments (`/* ... */`) immediately before the function or code block.
   - **C**: Use multi-line comments (`/* ... */`) similarly placed immediately before the function.
4. **Chain-of-Thought**: Before rewriting, internally verify that you understand every detail of the code.
5. **Output Requirements**: The final output must be the complete original code with **only the new documentation added**. The code must retain all its original functionality, now enhanced with the new comprehensive documentation.

### Revised Few-Shot Examples

#### Example 1: Python
**Original Code Sample:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add(5, 3))
```

**Expected Transformed Code:**
```python
"""
Overall Summary:
This Python script provides a basic arithmetic operation. It defines a function 'add' to compute the sum of two numbers and demonstrates its usage in the main execution block.
"""

def add(a, b):
    """
    Function 'add':
    - Purpose: Computes and returns the sum of two numbers.
    - Inputs:
        a: First number (int/float).
        b: Second number (int/float).
    - Output: Returns the computed sum.
    - Step-by-Step:
        1. Receives two input parameters.
        2. Computes the sum of the inputs.
        3. Returns the computed sum.
    - Example:
        Input: a = 5, b = 3
        Output: 8
    """
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    """
    Main Block:
    - Purpose: Demonstrates the use of the 'add' function.
    - Step-by-Step:
        1. Calls the 'add' function with sample inputs.
        2. Prints the resulting output.
    - Example:
        When add(5, 3) is called, the output is 8.
    """
    result = add(5, 3)
    print(result)
```

#### Example 2: JavaScript
**Original Code Sample:**
```javascript
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

console.log(multiply(4, 2));
```

**Expected Transformed Code:**
```javascript
/**
 * Overall Summary:
 * This JavaScript snippet provides a multiplication utility.
 * It defines a function 'multiply' that calculates the product of two numbers and logs the result.
 */

/**
 * Function 'multiply':
 * - Purpose: Calculates and returns the product of two numbers.
 * - Inputs:
 *   - x: The first number.
 *   - y: The second number.
 * - Output: Returns the product of x and y.
 * - Step-by-Step:
 *   1. Accepts two parameters.
 *   2. Multiplies the two parameters.
 *   3. Returns the computed product.
 * - Example:
 *   Input: x = 4, y = 2
 *   Output: 8
 */
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

/**
 * Main Execution Block:
 * - Purpose: Demonstrates the usage of the 'multiply' function.
 * - Step-by-Step:
 *   1. Calls the 'multiply' function with example inputs.
 *   2. Logs the result.
 * - Example:
 *   When multiply(4, 2) is called, the output is 8.

#### Example 3: Java

```java
public class Factorial {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(factorial(5));
    }
}

```java
/**
 * Overall Summary:
 * The Factorial class provides a method to compute the factorial of a number using recursion.
 * It also includes a main method to demonstrate its functionality.
 */

     * - Step-by-Step:
     *   1. If n is less than or equal to 1, returns 1.
