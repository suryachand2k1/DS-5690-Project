    "# Anthropic Scoring Script\n",
    "\n",
    "This script uses **Anthropic's Claude model** to evaluate the quality of documentation generated by various large language models (LLMs). It produces structured evaluations (scores and reasons) and saves them in individual CSV files per model.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üß† What It Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loads an input dataset** with:\n",
    "   - Original source code\n",
    "   - Documented versions from different LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sends each documented code snippet** (with its original code) to Claude via the Anthropic API.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Receives a JSON response** containing:\n",
    "   - `final_score` (numerical rating)\n",
    "   - `reason` (justification for the score)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stores the results** in separate CSV files for each documentation model inside the `Anthropic-Scoring` folder.\n",
