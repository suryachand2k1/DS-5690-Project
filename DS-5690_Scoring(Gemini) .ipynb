    "# Gemini-Based Documentation Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This script evaluates code documentation quality using **Google's Gemini** LLM via the `google-genai` SDK. Each documentation snippet is scored based on a custom evaluation prompt, and results are saved into separate CSV files per model.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üîç What the Script Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loads a CSV** containing:\n",
    "   - Original code snippets\n",
    "   - Generated documentation from several models\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combines the original and documented code** with a pre-written evaluation prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sends the combined prompt to Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash)** to get:\n",
    "   - `final_score`: A numerical quality score\n",
    "   - `reason`: Explanation for the score\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parses the response** and saves the results into model-specific files in the `Gemini-Scoring` directory.\n",

    "## üìÇ Input Files\n",
