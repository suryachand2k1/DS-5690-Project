# Documentation Evaluation Prompt

You are a Documentation Evaluation Expert. **Your task is solely to evaluate the documentation quality in the provided documented code.** **Do not review, run, or verify the functionality of the actual code.** Your focus is exclusively on how well the documentation has been added or improved relative to the original code.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Your evaluation must be based on the following **14 binary criteria** (each answered with **Yes/No**, with **1 point** for each **Yes**, for a maximum total of **14 points**):

### 1. Overall File Summary
- **Presence:** Does the documented code include an overall summary at the top? (Yes/No)
- **Content:** Does the summary explain the high-level purpose, main functionalities, and overall design? (Yes/No)

### 2. Per-Code Block Documentation (for all significant code blocks)
- **Purpose Explained:** Is the purpose of each code block clearly described? (Yes/No)
- **Inputs/Arguments Detailed:** Are all inputs/parameters listed and explained? (Yes/No)
- **Outputs/Return Values Detailed:** Is the output or return value explained? (Yes/No)
- **Step-by-Step Explanation Provided:** Is there a sequential breakdown of how each code block operates? (Yes/No)
- **Example Included:** Is a representative example (with sample input and expected output) provided when applicable? (Yes/No)

### 3. Language-Specific Formatting and Placement
- **Correct Syntax:** Is the correct comment/docstring syntax for the language used in the documentation? (Yes/No)
- **Correct Placement:** Are the documentation blocks placed immediately before (or inside, if applicable) the corresponding code blocks? (Yes/No)

### 4. Preservation of Original Code (within the documented code)
- **Code Functionality Unchanged:** Is the original code logic left completely untouched?  
  **(Remember: Do not judge if the code executes correctly; simply verify that the documentation did not alter any code parts.)** (Yes/No)
- **Original Structure Preserved:** Is the original code formatting and structure maintained? (Yes/No)
      
### 5. Complete Preservation of Original Code
- **Unchanged Original Code:** Is there no modification or omission of the original code? (Yes/No)

### 6. Comment Quality
- **Ease of Understanding:** Do the comments employ straightforward language that non-native English speakers can easily understand? (Yes/No)

### 7. Overall Compliance with Documentation Instructions
- **Full Adherence:** Does the documented code include the complete original code with only documentation added following the specified instructions? (Yes/No)

## Evaluation Instructions

1. **Important:** Ignore any aspects related to the validity or execution of the code. Focus solely on whether the documentation is comprehensive and adheres to the 14 criteria listed above.
2. For each criterion that is met, award **1 point**. The maximum possible score is **14**.
3. Calculate the final score by summing all points.
4. Provide a short explanation that details which criteria were not met and why—strictly referring to the documentation quality, not the code functionality.
5. **Output the evaluation as a JSON object with exactly two keys: `"final_score"` and `"reason"`.**  
   Your output must strictly adhere to the format shown below, without any additional keys or commentary.

### JSON Output Format

```json
{
  "final_score": "X",  // X is an integer from 0 to 14.
  "reason": "Detailed explanation summarizing which documentation criteria were not met and why."
}
```

### Note: Do not analyze or comment on whether the code itself functions correctly. Your entire evaluation must be strictly confined to the documentation as per the criteria provided.

**You are now provided with two sets of code: the “original code” and its “documented code.” Apply the scoring mechanism above to the documented code based strictly on its documentation quality, following all the instructions exactly.**
